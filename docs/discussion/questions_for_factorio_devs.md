* What is the exact criteria for determining if a entity or blueprint is flip-able?
* What are the exact criteria for mod archive naming, both externally (???.zip) and internally (how many folders can exist, what can their names be, etc.). I've recently come across some mods that have multiple folders inside a mod's zip file; how does Factorio find the "correct" folder in that case?
* What is the exact conditions for trains to couple when placed? More specifically, what is the "correct" way to space and orient rolling stock on curved rails? From my deduction I was able to deduce that trains on curved rails seem to follow a path that corresponds to 1/8th of a circle with a radius of 10 tiles, but when checking the linear distance (and even the arc-distance) between train cars the value seems to vary by several tenths of a tile. On straight rails it's clearly a distance of 7, but what is the way to calculate it for curved rails?
