# Changelog

# 1.1.0
* Added a number of missing prototype objects that are blueprintable:
    * `SimpleEntityWithOwner`
    * `SimpleEntityWithForce`
    * `PlayerPort`
* Fixed an issue where color settings were not recognized in the settings stage (#103)
* Fixed issue loading IndustrialRevolution modpack (regression) (#98)

## 1.0.6
* Updated `factorio-data` to version `1.1.88`
* Updated `compatibility/defines.lua` to `1.1.88`
* Merged arpheno's pull request:
    * Fixed `Pump` so that it now correctly exports it's `direction`
* Merged SIGSTACKFAULT's pull requests:
    * Fix type annotation of `Tile.__init__()`
    * Fix type annotation of `BlueprintBook.insert()`
* `draftsman-update` is now (finally) able to load mods from folder directories instead of just zip archives
* `draftsman-update` will now prefer mods in folders instead of zip archives if one of each type present and they have the exact same ID and version (I think this matches Factorio, create an issue if it's not)
* Added `--report` command to `draftsman-update` that prints out a list of currently active mods and their versions (to aid in bug reports)
* Fixed Lua `defines` table not being defined by the time `factorio-data/core` runs (#85)
* Fixed UTF-8 BOM tokens not being properly stripped from all mod Lua files, resulting in issues when sending to Lupa (#84)
* Changed the Lua load process a whole lot for `draftsman-update`, hopefully behaving more predictably and causing no regressions

## 1.0.5
* Added `get_blueprintable_from_JSON()` and patched `get_blueprintable_from_string()` so that it no longer converts the string twice (accidentally)
* Fixed issue where integer `playback_volume` values on programmable speakers wasn't getting coerced to a float and failing validation (#72)
* Fixed Blueprintable objects not being correctly initialized from their constructor when JSON dicts were passed as an argument (#75)
* Fixed `OverlappingObjectsWarning` being incorrectly emitted when `Gates` overlap `StraightRails` (they now are only emitted if they're not perpendicular to each other) (#76)
* Fixed `ConstantCombinator` not recognizing the `is_on` member (#77)

## 1.0.4
* Updated `factorio-data` to version `1.1.80`
* Updated `compatibility/defines.lua` to `1.1.80`
* Merged louga31's pull request:
    * Fix recipes so that they correctly read either internal format
* Fixed an issue where not all entities were being assigned to `entities.flippable` (#61)
* Fixed mod dependency loading (hopefully) so that it should actually handle recursive requires across an arbitrary number of different mods (#70)
* Fixed an issue where required Lua files with a single prepended dot or slash would break the path resolution (#70)

## 1.0.3
* Updated `factorio-data` to version `1.1.76` (latest stable)
* Updated `compatibility/defines.lua` to `1.1.76` (latest stable)
* Merged penguincounter's pull request:
    * Fixed logistics requester and buffer chest signatures not having the correct `circuit_mode_of_operation` key
* Added a `dump_format()` method to entities that outputs a user friendly description of all of the possible key/value entries in the exported blueprint dict
    * Still needs to be done for Blueprintable; ideally there would be a `Exportable` parent class that would implement the madness
    * Also need to investigate faster validation options since schema is pretty slow; maybe we can unify and improve speed at the same time
* Added a `get_format()` method intended to get a readable formatted string (that can easily be autogenerated at the top of each entity in the documentation! Not yet but soon)
* Changed `_exports` dict to be both more user readable and only defined on a per class basis instead of a per instance basis (so memory usage should be down)
* Prepped `env.py` for when Lupa version 2.0 goes live (which will resolve #50)
* Fixed `"Mining_Drones_Harder"` mod not loading because of stray "__MACOSX" folder defined alongside (#55)
* Fixed `"FactorioExtended-Plus-Logistics"` not loading due to internal file titled `__init__.lua` (#56)
* Fixed `env.extract_entities().categorize_entities()` to `get` flags instead of assuming they exist (`"flags"` set is common but optional)

## 1.0.2
* Added `UpgradePlanner` and `DeconstructionPlanner` (#40)
* Created an abstract class `Blueprintable` which now implements `Blueprint`, `BlueprintBook`, `UpgradePlanner`, and `DeconstructionPlanner` to increase code reuse
* Added `description` attribute to `Blueprint` and `BlueprintBook` (#41)
* Changed the behavior of `draftsman-update` to normalize all mod names to have no spaces (probably not perfect, but should work for now) (#49)
* Added a `--path` argument to `draftsman-update` so you can specify exactly where to load mods from instead of only the installation directory (#49)
* Draftsman now distributes with a vanilla set of pickle data files, so you no longer need to run `draftsman-update` on first install (suggestion from rpdelaney)
* Rolling Stock (Locomotives and Wagons) should now have proper collisions that are based on their `orientation` and issue correct warnings (#47)
* Updated the documentation around `draftsman-update` to make it more clear and reflect recent changes
* Updated all `Blueprintable` documentation files such that they now include a plaintext representation of their JSON structure

## 1.0.1
* Updated `factorio-data` to version `1.1.65`
* Fixed #38 and #39

## 1.0.0
* Updated `factorio-data` to version `1.1.61`
* Added a `Vector` class to represent 2d positions, and changed most of the code to reflect this change
    * This is a breaking change, but it should be much more natural to access positions by attribute `x` and `y` instead of `["x"]` and `["y"]`
    * By specifying a class like this, custom operators are allowed such as vector math, which means that offsetting positions and other operations have become much easier as a result
    * `Vector` has a static member function `from_other()` that constructs a `Vector` object from all valid formats accepted in the past (`tuple`, `dict`, `list`, etc.) which is used in all standard functions, so you shouldn't have to change any of their signatures
    * `Vector` also has a `to_dict()` method to turn it back into it's dictionary format for exporting (`{"x": ..., "y": ...}`)
    * The `Vector` class is only used on the "outermost" layer due to performance reasons, internally the most common representation is still `list[float, float]`
* Added an abstract `Shape` class, along with two implementations: `AABB` and `Rectangle`
    * `AABB` and `Rectangle` are now used for issuing `OverlappingObjectWarning` 
* All functions that used to use `Sequences` or `list[list[float], list[float]]` have been changed to `Vector` and `AABB` respectively for user clarity
* Added another class: `CollisionSet`, which is a list of `Shapes` used for checking if two `Entity`s intersect one another
    * This was needed because curved rails have 2 collision boxes instead of a single one
    * Collision sets also support rotations, which means that rotations are automatically generated or specified manually for edge cases like rails
    * In essence, `CollisionSets` provide more flexibility for entity footprints on a per-entity-type (or even per-entity) level
* Added `find_entity_at_position()` so you can simply check for any entity in particular at a position instead of having to use fully-blown `find_entities_filtered` or the more-specific `find_entity()` function
* Abstracted `SpatialHashMap` to be an implementation of abstract class `SpatialDataStructure`, which will allow for different implementations such as quadtrees or other algorithms if they happen to be more performant than hash-mapping (For now all `Collections` still use `SpatialHashMap` though)
* Renamed `entity_hashmap` and `tile_hashmap` to more generic `entity_map` and `tile_map` to reflect the above change
* Move almost all entity insert/set/remove logic to `EntityCollection.on_entity_insert`, `on_entity_set`, and `on_entity_remove`, which gets called from `EntityList.insert` and related 
* Added `on_tile_insert`, `on_tile_set`, and `on_tile_remove` to `TileCollection` to mirror the changes to `EntityCollection`
* Added `copy` keyword to `TileList.insert` and `TileList.append` to mirror `EntityList.insert` and `EntityList.append`
* Added Entity/Tile merging
  * Added `merge` keyword to both `EntityList.insert/append` and `TileList.insert/append`
  * Attempting to use `merge=True` keywords and `copy=False` will result in a `ValueError`, as this behavior is loosely defined (for now at least)
* Rails now properly issue `OverlappingObjectsWarnings`; Rails can overlap each other provided they don't have the exact same position + direction + type
* Another big documentation pass
* Split the `signatures.CONTROL_BEHAVIOR` into many sub implementations, which should improve both safety and (hopefully) performance
* Fixed #24, #25, #27, #32, #33, and #34

## 0.9.7
* Merged louga31's pull request
    * Rewrite of the `_shift_key_indices` in `EntityList` to make it faster using list comprehension
* Merged elswindle's pull request
    * Moved conversion of associations from `Blueprint.load_from_string` to `Blueprint.setup` so they always take place
    * Fixed `UndergroundBelt` `io_type` attribute not reading correctly from key `type`
    * Changed test case to account for this
* Added `DirectionalMixin` to `AssemblingMachine` (as technically it can have it in select circumstances)
* Fixed load conflict between `items` and `recipe` in `AssemblingMachine` (#23)
* Fixed `setup.py` so that it properly requires `typing_extensions` on versions of Python prior to 3.8 (#30)
* Fixed importing `Literal` so that it follows the above change (#30)
* Fixed an issue where `BlueprintBook` icons were not properly set and issued an incorrect warning (#31)

## 0.9.6
* Merged sposker's pull request
    * Fixed an bug where `IndexError` would be triggered on setting the final item filter slot
    * Updated `signatures.CONTROL_BEHAVIOR` to include the `send_to_train` key
* Merged elswindle's pull request
    * Dictionary Blueprints and BlueprintBook's are now properly converted to `Blueprint` and `BlueprintBook` objects when added to a `BlueprintableList`
* Fixed documentation for `FilterMixin.set_item_filters` that labeled `"name"` key as `"signal"`
* Made docs for `FilterMixin.set_item_filters` and `FilterMixin.set_item_filter` more clear
* Changed `signals.raw` to actually be the extraction from `data.raw` so people can query the order strings and other information (#17)
* Sorted `signals.raw` according to signal-processing order (virtual -> fluid -> item) instead of item sort order (#17)
* Added `signals.type_of` as a more specific structure to fulfill the old functionality of `signals.raw` (#17)
* Changed the functionality of `ConstantCombinator` so that attempting to set one of it's signals to a pure virtual signal results in a `DraftsmanWarning` (because for some grotesque reason Factorio actually allows this)
* Renamed `InvalidConnectionError` to more general `InvalidAssociationError` and updated documentation
* Removed requirement for `Groups` to have an ID associated with it (this was required in the past, but is no longer necessary)
* Fixed unable to find connectable entities when calling `Blueprint.generate_power_connections()` on blueprint that contained `Groups` (#19)
* Added the capability to specify connections based on entity reference as well instead of just ID or index (`[add/remove]_power_connection`, `[add/remove]_circuit_connection`) (#19)
    * Made these functions issue `InvalidAssociationError` when attempting to connect two entities that lie outside of the `EntityCollection`
    * Added recursive `__contains__` function to `EntityList` to facilitate the above
* Fixed copying of entities between `Blueprints` and `Groups` (#20)
* Added capability to deepcopy `Entities`, `Groups`, and `Blueprints`, with appropriate errors
* Added capability to set the `entities` of a `Blueprint` or `Group` to another `Blueprints` or `Groups` `entities` (#16)
* Added optional `string` keyword for the constructor of `Group` so you can import a blueprint string directly into a group instead of having to create a "scratch" `Blueprint`

## 0.9.5
* Added `keywords` to `setup.py`
* Added `__contains__` function to `Blueprint` (I thought it was inferred from `__getitem__`, whoops) (#14)
* Added `defines.lua` as a more comprehensive solution to the Factorio `defines` issue (#15)
* Added distinguishing between multiple versions of the same mod; the latest mod is always preferred, with warnings for duplicates issued (#15)
* Started work on `RailPlanner`
* Other minor documentation changes
* Fixed the old repo link in `setup.py`
* Fixed #13:
    * Implemented the functionality according to the game, preserving Factorio safety

    * Updated documentation to reflect these changes
* Moved initialization of `Blueprint.area` attribute before loading entities in `Blueprint.setup()` (#14)

## 0.9.4
* Added the capability to display any logged messages to during `draftsman-update` with the command line argument `-l` or `--log`
* Added `prep.py` to prepare releases more automatically so I don't miss steps like a fool (maybe I'll integrate something like poetry in the future)
* Updated `env.py` to create the `factorio-mods` folder if it doesn't exist, in case the user accidentally deleted it
* Updated `env.py` so that everything is now sorted (mostly) properly
* Updated readme to point to related Alt-F4 article
* Updated `requirements.txt` to include `build` for development
* Changed the manner in which sort items are searched in `env.py` (related to issue #9)
* Changed the manner in which the order of items are determined so there's less redundancy
* Changed `normalize_module_name` from non-digit characters to alphanumeric characters (duh!) (#11)
* Changed `normalize_module_name` to distinguish between "slash" paths and "dot" paths and only convert "dot" paths if found (#11)
* Added more duct tape to the local file requiring issue machine (#11)
* Removed `temp.py` from GitHub distribution, it was only really intended as scrap paper for me
* Fixed #10
* Fixed #12

## 0.9.3
* Fixed #9

## 0.9.2
* Added `signals` attribute to `ConstantCombinator`, which aliases `control_behavior["filters"]`
* (Re)Added circuit attributes back to `ArithmeticCombinator` and `DeciderCombinator`
* Minor docs fixes
* Bugfix: resolved #6
* Bugfix: resolved #8 (At least for now, current behavior should be more predictable)
* Also cleaned and documented the `update` process in `env.py` to make it a little clearer exactly what's going on, and trimmed the fat

## 0.9.1
* Updated `factorio-data` to `1.1.58`
* Added description of `control_behavior` attribute structure to `docs/source` folder
* Added read-only `global_position` property to `SpatialLike`; allows for efficient querying of an objects root-most position
* Added `SpatialHashMap.get_all`
* Added `utils.flatten_entities` since it's used in a number of places
* Added a `ItemCapacityWarning`, issued when `*Container` objects request items that exceed their inventory size

* Integrated `entities.flippable` into `Entity` class, as well as `Transformable`
* Updated `tox.ini` to use `--no-mods` on `draftsman-update`
* Reworked `SpatialHashMap` and `get_area` to use `global_position` instead of `position`
* Reworked `RequestItemsMixin` and added it to more prototypes
* Split `ModuleSlotsMixin` from `RequestItemsMixin` to compartmentalize more
* Adding science pack item requests to a `Lab` no longer raises a warning (works with any lab)
* Made `set_x_filter` code more consistent across different prototype filter types
* Added folder loading to `draftsman-update`
* Documentation format fixes/additions
* Bugfix: Fixed the local paths that now point from `factorio-draftsman` instead of `factorio-draftsman/draftsman` in `draftsman-update` for folders
* Bugfix: Changed Lua file requiring so that it makes (somewhat) more sense; Honestly the whole thing is pretty fricking scuffed, and needs a redo
* Bugfix: Fixed `OverlappingObjectsWarning` occurring when placing two groups with the same local coordinates but different global coordinates in an `EntityCollection`
* Bugfix: Fixed Maximum recursion depth errors when running `examples/item_stack_signals.py` with large modpacks with many items; this should no longer occur period

    * (Should work with every version between, but I'm too lazy to test right now)
* Got everything prepared (I think) for building and ultimately distribution
* Fixed `setup.py` so that it should work with all versions greater than 2.7 (as well as requirements.txt)

* Added lots of utility functions related to `SpatialHashMap`
* Changed Blueprint `entities` and `tiles` to `KeyList` instead of `list`
* Added Blueprint warnings

## **0.3.5.1**
* Changed ALL of the setters to use properties because I didn't know Python properties _existed_

* Made the testing suite compatible (or, at least *more* compatible) with mods
* Added LogisticActiveContainer and LogisticPassiveContainer to complete the logistic suite
(I think its clearer this way rather than treating them as containers)
* Hundreds of other small changes

* Split all of the entity definitions into their own file (much clearer)
* Added `image_converter.py` example
