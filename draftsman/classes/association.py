        Checking the equality of two Associations checks to make sure that they
        point to the exact same entity in memory, which is important for entity
        resolution. However, entity comparisons themselves are on a per value
        basis. For example:

        .. code-block:: python

            entity1 = Container()

        checks for equality between the referenced objects.
