"""
Allows the user to import, create, manipulate, and export Factorio blueprint
strings.

`draftsman` attempts to provide a convinient, 'one-stop-shop' solution to the
problem of programmatically creating blueprint strings, used for automation of
designing structures that would be too tedius to build otherwise.

In addition to providing the bare functionality of importing and exporting,
`draftsman` is designed with the developer in mind, and has a wide array of
methods and classes designed to write clean, self-documenting scripts.
`draftsman` is also well-documented, well-tested, and easy to install.
