Illustation of how to use the RailPlanner class. It is a child class of Group,

provides a set of turtle-like commands not unlike the in-game rail building GUI.

    # don't line up with each other. This is because diagonals going in any
    # particular direction can actually occupy one of 2 different spots on the
    # same 2x2 tile "cell". RailPlanner prefers the "left" side based on it's
    # head direction, but can be changed by changing the `diagonal_side`
