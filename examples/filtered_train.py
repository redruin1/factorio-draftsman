# filtered_train.py

"""
Creates a 1-N train that filters its cargo inventories based on a set of inputs.
Input is provided by dict `contents`, where each key is an item to filter and 
its value is a positive integer indicating the number of inventory slots to 
filter with that item.

Slots are filled sequentially starting in the top left and working across. If
the total number of slots cannot fit in the current cargo wagon(s), new wagons
are added as necessary in order to satisfy `contents`.

Can be used to dynamically create specifically designed supply trains for 
specific purposes, such as building, defense repair, ammo supply, and so on.
Care should be taken across train boundaries however as this script makes no 
attempt to organize the entries by train, and as a result item slots can be 
split across multiple trains which is probably undesirable for this purpose.
