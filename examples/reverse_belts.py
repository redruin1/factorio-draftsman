# reverse_belts.py
"""
An example of how to use `reverse_belts` on a passed in blueprint or blueprint book.
`reverse_belts` reverses the direction of belt entities in-place such that they
preserve their continuity, such as around corners. The script prompts the user
for a blueprint string input from stdin.

If a blueprint string is passed in, a blueprint string is output to stdout which
corresponds to every belt entity reversed, including undergrounds and splitters.

If a blueprint book is passed in, the script recurses through all sub-blueprint
books and sub-blueprints and flips the belts inside all of them. Any upgrade/
deconstruction planner inside any of the nested blueprint books are ignored.
The resultant blueprint book with all belts reversed is printed back to stdout.

If a upgrade/deconstruction planner is passed in, the script prints "Unexpected
blueprintable type" and exits.
